# Airline-project3
Airline Data Analysis, Performance &amp; Dashboard

# .Objective

The main goal of this project is to analyze airline operational and financial performance using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and to build an interactive dashboard that helps airlines, airports, and passengers make better decisions.
 Steps & Workflow

#.Data Collection

Airline dataset containing details such as:

Flight ID / Index

Source & Destination

Departure & Arrival Times

Flight Duration

Stops (Direct / Connecting)

Price

Day/Date of Journey

Class (Economy/Business)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Cleaning: Handling null values, duplicates, incorrect time formats.

Descriptive Analysis:

Which routes are most frequently used?

Average flight duration by route.

Distribution of ticket prices by class.

Univariate Analysis: (Single-column analysis)

Example: Ticket price distribution, number of flights per airline.

Bivariate Analysis: (Comparing two columns)

Example: Price vs Stops, Duration vs Airline.

Multivariate Analysis:

Example: Price variation by Airline, Class & Route combined.

Outlier Detection: Finding unusually high/low prices.

Performance Insights

Operational Performance:

On-time vs delayed flights.

Busiest routes & peak hours.

Financial Performance:

Revenue trends by airline & class.

Most profitable routes.

Customer Insights:

Which class (Economy/Business) is most preferred?

Seasonal demand patterns.

Dashboard Development (Using Power BI / Tableau)

Key KPIs:

Total Flights

Average Price

Average Delay

Revenue per Airline

Charts & Visuals:
